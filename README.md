# Twitter_Scrapping_Hive_Pyspark_MiniProject
Objective is to run queries on big data for descriptive analysis. In this we scrapped data from twitter, then preprocessing was done and finally we loaded it into hive using hdfs filesystem. Moreover, we visualized data using pyspark by loading hive table on it. Here we used SQL language for analyzing the data.
